This Python script helps you remember and celebrate the birthdays of your friends and family. It checks a stored list of birthdays, and if today's date matches any entry, it automatically sends a personalized birthday greeting via email to the respective person. This ensures you never miss wishing your loved ones on their special day.


Create a birthdays.csv file, add the names, emails and birth dates as given in the template of birthdays.csv
